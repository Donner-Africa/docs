This AML Policy outlines Donner’s approach to complying with all applicable laws and regulations, including: </p><ul><li>The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) AML/CFT Manual</li><li>Relevant provisions of the Money Laundering (Prohibition) Act</li><li>Other guidelines issued by the CBN</li></ul><p>This policy applies to:</p><ul><li>All Donner employees and management</li><li>All platform users, including campaign organizers and donors</li><li>Any third parties or service providers that help facilitate transactions on Donner</li></ul><p><strong>1.2 Risk-Based Approach</strong><br> Donner adopts a Risk-Based Approach (RBA) to identify, assess, and mitigate money laundering and terrorist financing (ML/TF) risks. Higher-risk transactions, customers, and projects receive enhanced due diligence, while lower-risk categories receive proportional measures. </p><p><strong>1.3 Customer Identification and Verification</strong><br> Before disbursing funds or allowing campaigns to go private, Donner ensures all Know Your Customer (KYC) requirements (as outlined in our KYC Policy) are fulfilled. Additional checks (e.g., Politically Exposed Persons (PEP) screening, sanctions lists) are conducted as necessary. </p><p><strong>1.4 Transaction Monitoring</strong><br> All transactions are monitored for suspicious patterns, such as sudden large donations inconsistent with donor profile, donations from high-risk geographical locations, or repeated small donations structured to evade detection. Monitoring is both automated and manual to quickly identify and escalate red flags. </p><p><strong>1.5 Reporting and Escalation</strong><br><em>Internal Reporting:</em> Any suspicious activities must be reported to the Compliance Officer, who determines if further investigation is needed.<br><em>Regulatory Reporting:</em> If confirmed suspicious, Donner files a Suspicious Transaction Report (STR) with the Nigerian Financial Intelligence Unit (NFIU) and cooperates with authorities. </p><p><strong>1.6 Record Keeping</strong><br> Donner maintains records of customer identification documents, transaction histories, and relevant communications for at least 5 years (or as required by law) after the completion of a transaction or relationship. </p><p><strong>1.7 Training and Awareness</strong><br> All Donner employees receive periodic AML/CFT training, including how to recognize suspicious transactions and escalate issues. Training is updated regularly to reflect new typologies and regulations. </p><p><strong>1.8 Sanctions and Enforcement</strong><br> Donner reserves the right to take appropriate action (freezing accounts, rejecting transactions, or terminating relationships) against users in breach of AML/CFT requirements. Organisation&#39; non-compliance may result in disciplinary action or legal consequences. </p><h3 class="mt-5 mb-3" id="dispute">Dispute Policy</h3><p><strong>2.1 Purpose</strong><br> Donner aims to provide a transparent process for resolving disputes between donors, campaign organizers, and the platform.

Third-party verification services may be used. If verification is successful, the user is granted access to the platform; if not, Donner may request more info or deny the application. </p><p><strong>3.4 Data Protection and Confidentiality</strong><br> Personal data is stored securely in compliance with the Nigeria Data Protection Regulation (NDPR).
